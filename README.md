# 🚧 Mondu Demo Integration 🚧

This repo aims to help you in setting up a demo app for Mondu BNPL. It's built with:

- NodeJS
- Express
- Pug as templating engine
- axios and fetch for async API communication
- Bootstrap

## How To Run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hreinberger/mondu-node.git && cd mondu-node
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
# insert your API key in the .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

Running in dev mode opens up a [Localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) back to your local machine. You can get the link and your local IP from the nodeJS console. You can access the app either with the localtunnel link or via `localhost:3000`. The localtunnel feature is needed for redirecting you back from Mondu's hosted checkout to the app.

### Bring your own API Key

In order for the app to work, wou'll have to set your Mondu API key in the `.env` file. Don't have one yet? Reach out to your Mondu representative!

## Docker

The Repo is prepared to be run in a vscode dev container, Github Codespace or dockerized on any machine you like.
To run it in a more production-like environment, you can do this:

```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
```

⚠️ The app is not checked for vulnerabilities, so be careful when you want to run it in a public environment (like the Internet!)

## Payment Flows

The app has support for two types of UX flows.

### Hosted Checkout (Recommended)

Here, Mondu will save orders with successful hosted checkout interactions in the `authorized` state.
The order then needs to be confirmed by the merchant with an addidtional API request.

For this flow to work, the app opens a localtunnel to your machine. Upon redirection to the success page of the app, you'll need to enter your current public IP as an anti-abuse method. The app logs the public IP to console on every start.

    Mondu -->>- Merchant: hosted checkout URL
    Merchant -->> Buyer: Redirect to Mondu hosted checkout
    Buyer ->>+ Mondu: Interact on Mondu Hosted Checkout
    Mondu -->>- Buyer: Confirm Order
    note over Merchant,Mondu: Order in authorized state
    Merchant ->> Mondu: Confirm Order
    Mondu -->> Merchant: Order confirmed

```

### Confirmation Flow (Mondu Widget)

In this flow, Mondu confirms or declines an order once the buyer's interaction with the widget is complete.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Buyer ->> Merchant: Confirm Order ("Buy Now")
    Merchant ->>+ Mondu: Create Order
    Mondu -->>- Merchant: Order Token
    Merchant -->> Buyer: Show Widget
    Buyer ->>+ Mondu: Enrich Widget Data
    Mondu -->>- Buyer: Show Widget Response
    Mondu -->> Merchant: Webhook order/confirmed
```

## "Backend"

You can show recent orders by visiting the `/orders` page.

## Webhooks

You can show registered webhooks by visiting the `/webhooks` page.

You can register the webhooks for two topics at the moment:

- order by clicking upon `Regiter Order Webhook`,

- invoice by clicking upon `Regiter Invoice Webhook`,

If there there other webhook registerd for a given topic, please use `Remove` button to remove the endpoint and regitring the new one.

Remember that other applications might use the webhooks you want to remove.
